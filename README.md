# Node.js/Express Boilerplate with Typescript, Jest, Prettier etc.

A bare minimum backend-typescript boilerplate with everything configured (**clone and go**)

It runns [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) on all changed typescript files in commit.
Moreover it also runs [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and unit tests before it allows you to do `git push`.

$ npm install

```

```
